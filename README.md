### FAQ

#### Q: Who can I write to?

You can write to anyone once they accepted your friend request.

#### Q: How can I find my friends?

You can use **Global Search** to find friends and send them friend requests.

#### Q: What do the check marks mean?

One check — message delivered to the Nightingale cloud and your friend has been notified if he allows notifications.
Two checks — message read (your friend opened Nightingale and opened the conversation with the message).

#### Q: Can I hide my ‘last seen’ time?

You can choose who sees this info in Privacy and Security settings.

Remember that you won't see Last Seen timestamps for people with whom you don't share your own. You will, however, see
an approximate last seen value. This keeps stalkers away but makes it possible to understand whether a person is
reachable over Telegram. There are four possible approximate values:

Last seen recently — covers anything between 1 second and 2-3 days
Last seen within a week — between 2-3 and seven days
Last seen within a month — between 6-7 days and a month
Last seen a long time ago — more than a month (this is also always shown to blocked users)
